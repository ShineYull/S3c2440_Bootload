### Dedicated small system
The kernel written for the s3c2440 chip starts from scratch, and every file in the project is handwritten (except libgcc.a library and string library).
From assembly to C language, looking at the source code carefully can teach you how to drive the CPU.
How to write link scripts (.lds), how to write build files (make).
After self-modification, it can be used as a bootloader to start the linux kernel.
